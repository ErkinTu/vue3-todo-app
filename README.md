# 🧙‍♂️ Welcome to the Vue3 Todo App Setup Guide
So, you've cloned the Vue3 Todo App from GitHub and you're ready to unleash some frontend magic? Let’s get you up and running in no time 💻✨

## 🧰 Step 1: Install the dependencies
Open your terminal, navigate to your project folder, and run:

```bash
npm install
```
This command pulls in all the shiny packages listed in the package.json.
Like a chef gathering ingredients before making a delicious frontend stew 😋🍲

## 🚀 Step 2: Run the dev server
Once everything’s installed, fire up the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Boom 💥 — your app should now be live at http://localhost:5173 (or whatever Vite tells you in the terminal).
Start building, testing, and pretending like everything's under control 😅
<!--
## 🏗️ Step 3: Build for production
Want to impress your future self or your team?
Create an optimized production build with:

```bash
npm run build
```
Vite will handle all the heavy lifting and spit out a beautiful /dist folder for you to deploy 🌐📦

## 👀 Step 4: Preview the build
Wanna see how your production build looks before deploying?

```bash
npm run preview
```
It’ll spin up a local server that mimics production. No surprises later, promise 🤞
